Enables shortcode previews using the WordPress Gutenberg UI

== Description ==
This plugin adds a block `CD2 Shortcode`, which enables previewing shortcodes using the WordPress REST API.

All work from this plugin was originally part of works to get this functionality into Gutenberg pre-core merge.

This plugin only exists because the existing shortcode block doesn't give designers or non-coders anything to go on.

Due to gutenberg being a little unstable this plugin may break from time to time, let me know via the support tab, and I'll do my best to keep on top of it.

**Fixed**

* Gutenberg team has let to learn or care about stabilizing an API. Most patches to this have been changing JS namespaces. (Thanks for that).
